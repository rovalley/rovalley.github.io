  <p>The website craigslist lacks any sort of clear navigation. This design appears to be very antiquated, and the text is very hard to read because a lot of the headers appear to be cramped together. This website needs a total overhaul and update. It contains no color scheme and lacks background depth. The text and lack of logos seems to get lost in the reading. This web site design lacks style and uses plain text and no images. It might appear to many as crammed text with poor navigation and not user friendly. The web design is simple and lacks stimulus and interaction for the web user. The website might leave one wondering if this is a real 21st century completive website. Looking at the website in the context of being not modern and crammed, with too many entrees on one page. Small print makes it monotonous and busy. There are no curved corners, and it lacks aesthetic web design art that appeals to the eye. There is minimal text formatting and lack attractive icons that lead with not a clear purpose. Specifically noted a lot of links and headers, with a backward design format keeps it simple as just to be up on the internet for the sake of having a website. There is no attention to detail, it contains a messy unstructured lead, and some links are unclear between other sections one tries to navigate.
  As for the code it is hard to follow and is not clear.
