  <p>Nike’s website has various images of 360-degree views with multiple angles. Nike has a multitude of grid and four or more context images of shoes, gear, and sportswear. These colorful images show customers their products from many different angles, memorizing the customer to click, expand and take a close look at the crisp images. All the information and image can be viewed on a single page without clicking to visit another page to get access to what one is currently viewing, making the Nike website consumer friendly. Images are full size, bright, and detailed. It is easy to navigate as one can easily scroll down the single page to purchase Nike wear. What sets this website apart is its multitude of psychedelic colors. Used effectively to captivate the consumer to click on products for more information. Coinciding with its audience needs, customization is also available on the product list page. Toggling back and forth is obsolete on this web site, instead right-hand sidebars allow the user to select and purchase the correct Nike shoe size. A wish list, read product reviews all available at one’s fingertip without leaving the center page. It is the images that showcase the product that sets the Nike website apart from other competitors. Notably an interactive canvas that one can customize to one’s taste. Nike’s website is sleek with notable whitespaces as its core design. The code use to format the images on the website are nicely sized and spaced also the tables contain the information in a easy to navigate way.
