        Steph Curry is undoubtedly the best shooter in NBA history. This year marks the return of Clay,
        he has not played a game in almost 2 years becuasue of injuries. Clay is not our only player
        that is out, our center Wisemen has been out also. Even without these two key players the warriors
        are dominating this season. With there return they are for sure in a strong postion to win the NBA
        Finals. The warriors were a dynasty now they are trying to be that again.
